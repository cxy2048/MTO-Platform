## Introduction

The Multi-Task Optimization Platform (MTO Platform) is inspired by [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) and designed to facilitate experiments on multi-task optimization algorithms.

Environment: **Matlab >= R2020b**

## Guide

### Run MTO Platform

- matlab run **MTO.m**

### Add your own algorithm

- Inherit the **Base/Algorithm** class from the Algorithms folder to implement a new algorithm class and put it in the Algorithms folder or its subfolders
- Implement the inherited virtual functions according to the annotations of each virtual function in the Algorithm class.
- *Refer to the MFEA algorithm implementation*

### Add your own problem

- Inherit the **Base/Problem** class from the Problem folder to implement a new problem class and put it in the Problem folder or its subfolders
- Implement the inherited virtual functions according to the annotations of each virtual function in the Problem class.
- *Refer to the CEC2017_MTSO problem implementation*

### Use App Designer to modify the GUI interface

- Open the **GUI/MTO_Platform.mlapp** project file with App Designer in matlab and modify the GUI interface.
- Export to MTO.m file after modification
